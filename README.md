# Project -1 Client and Server-side Web IS Development

This assignment focuses on querying relational databases using SQL in PHP along with HTML/CSS.
The Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon is a game based upon the theory that every actor can be connected to actor Kevin Bacon by a chain of movies no more than 6 in length. Most, but not all, can reach him in 6 steps. 12% of all actors cannot reach him at all.
Your task for this assignment is to write the HTML/CSS and PHP code for a web site called MyMDb that mimics part of the popular IMDb movie database site. Your site will show the movies in which another actor has appeared with Kevin Bacon (if you prefer, you may use another actor rather than Kevin Bacon as the center point, so long as that actor is in your database and has many connections to other actors).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
XAMPP - Apache Server
```
```
MySQL-Server
```
```
XAMPP - Apache Server
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running


```
Install XAMPP and go to the local directory 'htdocs' of XAMPP
```
[Windows] C:\xampp\htdocs\ 

```
Copy 'CodeBusters.zip' to C:\xampp\htdocs\
```
```
Extract In the same folder under 'CodeBusters'
```
```
Now the directory should be 'C:\xampp\htdocs\CodeBusters\'
```
```
Start MySQL server
```
```
Open Browser and navigate to localhost/CodeBusters/
```

## Running the tests


1. As you open the link, the browser will prompt you for username,password and database name
(These details are for "MYSQL" connection)
Default values : username: root password:test123 database name: imdb

2. Once the connection is successful, page will specify that the connection was successful at the very top of the page.
If the connection was unsuccessful, it simply means that you have entered wrong details of your mysql connection.
Unless the connection is established, you won't be able to use the website. So make sure you enter proper connection details and database name.

3. Now type in the "First Name" of your favorite actor that you wish to compare with actor Kevin Bacon.
(Example : John)

4. Now click on "Search" and the page will provide you a list of all actors.

5. Select your favorite actor from the given list.

6. Now click on "Degree it!" button to get the outputs.

7. Keep scrolling down to see the outputs of the executed queries in the same page.

8. For another actor, simply scroll up to the first question to select your favorite actor (Step 3) and repeat.

9. Query that asks for actors with maximum movies in "User Preferred" Genre has two buttons, Press "Select Genre"
A list of available genres will appear and select anyone of the genres.
